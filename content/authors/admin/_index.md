Hello! I am Issac Lee who is a PhD candidate of Statistics & Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa. My beloved academic supervisor is [N.D. Shyamalkumar](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~nshyamal/).

I am generally interested in many machine learning techniques which can be applied in actuarial science field. More specifically, here are some lists of topics which graped my attention thesedays:
