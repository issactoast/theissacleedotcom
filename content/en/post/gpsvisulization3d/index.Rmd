### My test route in google map

I use the same that [I posted before](https://www.theissaclee.com/en/post/gpsvisulization/). The sample test route is square as follows:

![](https://www.theissaclee.com/en/post/gpsvisulization/myanimation.gif)

However, it is a 2d plot; it does not show the altitude information. The reason why I choose this route is that the course has turns, flat road, and inclined path at the same time. 

To show this, I decide to use [rgl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/vignettes/rgl.html) R package which can draw the 3D plot of GPS path.

## Load package

```{r include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
library(rgl)
```

## Load data

```{r}
mytelematics <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/theissacleedotcom/master/static/data/sampletrip.csv", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)

gps_data <- subset(mytelematics, select = c(Timestamp, Long, Lat, Alt.m.))
colnames(gps_data) <- c("Timestamp", "x", "y", "z")
```

GPS data is relatively straight forward. We have location information(longitude, latitude, and altitude) at each time step.

```{r results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
kable(head(gps_data, 100), format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")
```

### Route in 3D space

`rgl` R package is a useful tool for visualizing 3D data. To draw the graph, we need to open a pallet as like `par()` in the base plot as follows:
