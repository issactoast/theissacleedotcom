## Chi-square more than 2 proportions

We can use Chi-square test more than two categories.

### The usage of Instagram

Let us assume we have the following data:

|           | Freshmen| Non-Freshmen | Total |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Do not use| 30      | 40           |   70  |
| Often     | 180     | 180          |  360  |
| Everyday  | 400     | 350          |  750  |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Total     | 610     | 570          | 1180  |

This table is about two variables: School year and Instagram usage. 

The Instagram usage variable has three categories:

- Do not use (D)
- Often (O)
- Everyday (E)

Our goal is to test whether the usage distribution of Instagram defer from the school year. We can test this by looking the data as follows:

|           | prop. F |
|-----------|---------|
| Do not use| 30/70   |
| Often     | 180/360 |
| Everyday  | 400/750 |

If we assume that the population proportion of being a freshmen $p$, then $p$ should not differ from each category when the two variables are indenpendent. Thus, our null hypothesis looks like this:

$$
H_0: p_D = p_O = p_E
$$
which can be interpreted as follows:
the proportion of being a freshmen is not changed by each usage category.

#### Data load in SAS

```sas
data instagram ;
input schoolyear $ frequency $ count ;
datalines ;
F D 30
F O 180
F E 400
S D 40
S O 180
S E 350
;
run ;
```

#### Chi-square test in SAS

You can use `expected chisq` option at the same time.

```sas
proc freq data = instagram ;
  weight count ;
  tables schoolyear * frequency / expected chisq;
run ;
```

**Result**

```sas

Q. We want to test whether the two variables affects to each other. What is the Chi-square test statistic? **Ans**: 3.4099

Q. What is d.f.? **Ans**: 2 because we have 2 columns and 3 rows, so $(2-1) \times (3-1) = 2$

Q. If we use $\alpha = 0.05$, what is the decision? **Ans**: p-value is 0.1818 which is larger than the significance level. Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
