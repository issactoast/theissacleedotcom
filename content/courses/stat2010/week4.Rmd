## Normal distribution

From the basic statistics course, we are already familiar with a bell-shape distribution called Normal distribution.

Here are some characteristics of all Normal curves;

    - Symmetric, Unimodal
    - It can be specified by its mean and standard deviation.
    - Mean is related to center of the distribution.
    - Sd controls the spread of the distribution.
    - All Normal distribution obey the 68-95-99.7 rule.

Our textbook use the following notation for refering a specific normal distribution;

$$
\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)
$$
where $\mu$ represents the mean and $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation.

Let us look at the impact of the mean and standard deviation on the shape of Normal distribtuions.

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(-5, 5, by= 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l",
     xlim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     main = "Impact of the mean on Normal distribution",
     sub = "black: Normal(0, 1), red: Normal (2, 1)", axes = F)
abline(h=0)
points(x, dnorm(x, 2, sd = 1), type = "l", col = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(-4, 4, by = 2), las = 1)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(-5, 5, by= 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l",
     xlim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     main = "Impact of the std on Normal distribution",
     sub = "black: Normal(0, 1), red: Normal (0, 2)", axes = F)
abline(h=0)
points(x, dnorm(x, 0, sd = 2), type = "l", col = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(-4, 4, by = 2), las = 1)
```

## The 68-95-99.7 rule

The rule is as follows;

    - Approx. 68% of the obs. fall within one std. range of the mean.
    - Approx. 95% of the obs. fall within two std. range of the mean.
    - Approx. 99.7% of the obs. fall within three std. range of the mean.

## The standard Normal distrbituion

There is a very special Normal distribution among many Normal distribution. The standard Normal distribution is the Normal distribution with

$$
\mu = 0, \sigma = 1.
$$

The capital alphabet $Z$ is often used for a variable follows the standard Normal distribution. For this particular normal distribution, we will use the following notation:

$$
Z \sim \mathcal{N}\left(1, 0 \right)
$$

### Find prob. of $Z$ when the variable follows $\mathcal{N}\left(1, 0 \right)$

If we knows that the variable $Z$ follows the standard Normal distribution, then we can find any probability (or proportion) using the standard Normal [table](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/studentresources/college/statistics/bps8e/bps8e_tables/bps8e_tables.pdf).

#### Example (from our Lecture note)

 Suppose we live in a particular Scandinavian city, where temperature is measured
in Centigrade. Weather records kept for many years indicate that the temperature
at 11:00 a.m. on Jan. 28 follows a standard normal distribution. What proportion of years we can expect the temperature at this time to be less than or equal to $-1.5$&deg;C?

</summary>

Since the temperature follows the standard Normal distribution, I can use $Z_{s. city}$ to represent the temperature of Scandinavian city. We can write the following:

$$
Z_{s. city} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

Also the proportion that we want to find can be written as,

$$
P(Z_{s. city} \le -1.5)
$$

The above form corresponds to the table in p. 696 from the table pdf. From the first table, if we find $-1.5$ from the row names and $0.00$ from the coloum names, we can find the number $0.0668$ which is our answer.

Thus, we have the following:

$$
P(Z_{s. city} \le -1.5) = 0.0668
$$

## Standardization: Convert Normal distrbituion to standard Normal distribution

We have learned how to find a probability of proportions with a variable which follows standard Normal distribution in the previous section. Now, we are going to learn the method of convert a varible following an arbitrary Normal distribution to the one follwoing the standard Normal distribution.

$$
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma) \overset{convert}{\longrightarrow} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

All normal distributions would be the same if we measured in units of size $\sigma$ around the mean $\mu$ as center! If $x$ is an observation from a distribution that has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the standardized value of $x$ is

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
Standardized values are often called *z-scores*.

#### Example: Homework Scores

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
x <- seq(5, 20, by= 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x, 10, 2), type = "l",
     xlim = c(5, 15),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     main = "Distribution of Homework score",
     sub = "Normal(10, 2)",
     axes = F)
abline(h=0)
axis(1, at = seq(5, 15, by = 2), las = 1)
```

Professor uploads the distribution of Homework 1 score in ICON as above and anounced that the Homework scores follows Normal distribution with $\mu =10$, $\sigma = 2$. 

Q1. You checked your score out and found that your score was 12. What is the *z-score* of your homework score?

$$
z_{score} = \frac{x_{score} - 10}{2} = \frac{12 - 10}{2} = 1.
$$

Q2. We have 75 people registered in this course. How many people got the homework scores which are below yours? (You can approximate it using the proportion method)

Let us denote $X$ by the homework score of students in this class, and we know that it follows Normal distribution according to the professor:
$$
X_{score} \sim \mathcal{N}(10, 2)
$$

First, we need to figure out what is the proportion of people whose homework score is below 12. We can write it down as follows using statistical notation:

$$
P(X_{score} \le 12) = ?
$$
Now, we cannot calculate this proportion directly, since $X_{score}$ does not follow standard Normal distribution rather it follows $\mathcal{N}(10, 2)$. How can we conver this $X$ to $Z$? Standardization formula!

According to standardization formula, we know the following:

$$
Z_{score} = \frac{X_{score} - 12}{2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

If you find the *z-score* in the standard Normal table, you will know that
$$
P(X_{score} \le 12) \overset{stdardization}{=} P(Z_{score} \le 1) \overset{z-table}{=} 0.8413 
$$

Thus, we can conclude that there are 84.13% of people in this class have the homework score below 12, which is your score. So our final answer will be

$$
75 \times 0.8413 \approx 64
$$

About 64 students.

About 26 students. Why?

**Exercise (Hard but MUST be in the exam).** The professor told you that you have made a top 8% of the class room based on the homework score. Can you guess your homework score?

- Step 1. Find the $z$ score which corresponds to 0.92. (why?)
  $z$ score is 1.41.
- Step 2. Convert $z$ score to the homework distribution scale.
$$
\begin{align*}
your\underline{ }score & =\mu+\sigma\times z\\
 & =10+2\times1.41\\
 & =12.82
\end{align*}
$$
Your score is around 12.82.
