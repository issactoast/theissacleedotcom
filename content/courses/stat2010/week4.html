<h2>Normal distribution</h2>
<p>From the basic statistics course, we are already familiar with a bell-shape distribution called Normal distribution.</p>
<p>Here are some characteristics of all Normal curves;</p>
<pre><code>- Symmetric, Unimodal
- It can be specified by its mean and standard deviation.
- Mean is related to center of the distribution.
- Sd controls the spread of the distribution.
- All Normal distributions obey the 68-95-99.7 rule.</code></pre>
<p>Our textbook use the following notation for refering a specific normal distribution;</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the mean and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> represents the standard deviation.</p>
<p>Let us look at the impact of the mean and standard deviation on the shape of Normal distribtuions.</p>

<h2>The 68-95-99.7 rule</h2>
<p>The rule is as follows;</p>
<pre><code>- Approx. 68% of the obs. fall within one std. range from the mean.
- Approx. 95% of the obs. fall within two std. range from the mean.
- Approx. 99.7% of the obs. fall within three std. range from the mean.</code></pre>

<h2>The standard Normal distrbituion</h2>
<p>There is a very special Normal distribution among many Normal distribution. The standard Normal distribution is the Normal distribution with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mu = 0, \sigma = 1.
\]</span></p>
<p>The capital alphabet <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is often used for a variable follows the standard Normal distribution. For this particular normal distribution, we will use the following notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Z \sim \mathcal{N}\left(1, 0 \right)
\]</span></p>
<div id="find-prob.-of-z-when-the-variable-follows-mathcalnleft1-0-right" class="section level3">
<h3>Find prob. of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> when the variable follows <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}\left(1, 0 \right)\)</span></h3>
<p>If we knows that the variable <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> follows the standard Normal distribution, then we can find any probability (or proportion) using the standard Normal <a href="https://www.macmillanlearning.com/studentresources/college/statistics/bps8e/bps8e_tables/bps8e_tables.pdf">table</a>.</p>
<div id="example-from-our-lecture-note" class="section level4">
<h4>Example (from our Lecture note)</h4>
<p>Suppose we live in a particular Scandinavian city, where temperature is measured
in Centigrade. Weather records kept for many years indicate that the temperature
at 11:00 a.m. on Jan. 28 follows a standard normal distribution. What proportion of years we can expect the temperature at this time to be less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(-1.5\)</span>°C?</p>
<details>
<p><summary>
<font color="red"> Answer </font>
</summary></p>
<p>Since the temperature follows the standard Normal distribution, I can use <span class="math inline">\(Z_{s. city}\)</span> to represent the temperature of Scandinavian city. We can write the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Z_{s. city} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\]</span></p>
<p>Also the proportion that we want to find can be written as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(Z_{s. city} \le -1.5)
\]</span></p>
<p>The above form corresponds to the table in p. 696 from the table pdf. From the first table, if we find <span class="math inline">\(-1.5\)</span> from the row names and <span class="math inline">\(0.00\)</span> from the coloum names, we can find the number <span class="math inline">\(0.0668\)</span> which is our answer.</p>
<p><img src="normaltable.png" /></p>
<p>Thus, we have the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(Z_{s. city} \le -1.5) = 0.0668
\]</span></p>

<div id="standardization-convert-normal-distrbituion-to-standard-normal-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Standardization: Convert Normal distrbituion to standard Normal distribution</h2>
<p>We have learned how to find a probability of proportions with a variable which follows standard Normal distribution in the previous section. Now, we are going to learn the method of convert a varible following an arbitrary Normal distribution to the one follwoing the standard Normal distribution.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma) \overset{convert}{\longrightarrow} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\]</span></p>
<p>All normal distributions would be the same if we measured in units of size <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> around the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> as center! If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an observation from a distribution that has mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, the standardized value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]</span>
Standardized values are often called <em>z-scores</em>.</p>

<h4>Example: Homework Scores</h4>
<p><img src="/courses/stat2010/week4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Professor uploads the distribution of Homework 1 score in ICON as above and anounced that the Homework scores follows Normal distribution with <span class="math inline">\(\mu =10\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Q1. You checked your score out and found that your score was 12. What is the <em>z-score</em> of your homework score?</p>
<details>
<p><summary>
<font color="red"> Answer </font>
</summary></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z_{score} = \frac{x_{score} - 10}{2} = \frac{12 - 10}{2} = 1.
\]</span></p>
</details>
<p><br></p>
<p>Q2. We have 75 people registered in this course. How many people got the homework scores which are below yours? (You can approximate it using the proportion method)</p>
<details>
<p><summary>
<font color="red"> Answer </font>
</summary></p>
<p>Let us denote <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by the homework score of students in this class, and we know that it follows Normal distribution according to the professor:
<span class="math display">\[
X_{score} \sim \mathcal{N}(10, 2)
\]</span></p>
<p>First, we need to figure out what is the proportion of people whose homework score is below 12. We can write it down as follows using statistical notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(X_{score} \le 12) = ?
\]</span>
Now, we cannot calculate this proportion directly, since <span class="math inline">\(X_{score}\)</span> does not follow standard Normal distribution rather it follows <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(10, 2)\)</span>. How can we conver this <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>? Standardization formula!</p>
<p>According to standardization formula, we know the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Z_{score} = \frac{X_{score} - 12}{2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\]</span></p>
<p>If you find the <em>z-score</em> in the standard Normal table, you will know that
<span class="math display">\[
P(X_{score} \le 12) \overset{stdardization}{=} P(Z_{score} \le 1) \overset{z-table}{=} 0.8413 
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we can conclude that there are 84.13% of people in this class have the homework score below 12, which is your score. So our final answer will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
75 \times 0.8413 \approx 64
\]</span></p>
<p>About 64 students.</p>
</details>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> How many people got the homework scores which are between 10 and 12?</p>
<details>
<p><summary>
<emsp><font color="red"> Answer </font>
</summary>
<span class="math display">\[
75 \times 0.3413 \approx 26
\]</span></p>
About 26 students. Why?
</details>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Exercise (Hard but MUST be in the exam).</strong> The professor told you that you have made a top 8% of the class room based on the homework score. Can you guess your homework score?</p>
<details>
<summary>
<emsp><font color="red"> Answer </font>
</summary>
- Step 1. Find the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> score which corresponds to 0.92. (why?)
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> score is 1.41.
- Step 2. Convert <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> score to the homework distribution scale.
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
your\underline{ }score &amp; =\mu+\sigma\times z\\
 &amp; =10+2\times1.41\\
 &amp; =12.82
\end{align*}
\]</span>
Your score is around 12.82.
