```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{sas eval = FALSE}
data billion ;                     * gives dataset a name for SAS ;
input wlth age region $ ;          * names the variables in each row ;
                                   * $ after region identifies character vbl;
datalines ;
37 50 M
24 88 U
14 64 A
.
.
.
1 59 E
1 . E
1 . O
;
run ;                              * end of data step;
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{sas pressure, eval=FALSE}
proc print data = billion ;
run ;
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
