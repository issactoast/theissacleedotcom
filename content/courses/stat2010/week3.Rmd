## Correlation

Let $(x_i, y_i), i = 1, · · · , n$ be pairs of observations of $(x, y)$. Then the sample correlation between $x$ and $y$ is

$$
r=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s_{x}}\right)\left(\frac{y_{i}-\bar{y}}{s_{y}}\right)
$$
where $x, y$ denote the sample mean of $x$ and $y$ respectively and $s_x, s_y$ denote the sample standard deviations of $x$ and $y$ respectively.

- Sample correlation is a measure of linear relationship between two variables.
- $r$ is always between −1 and 1.
- $r > 0$ indicates positive linear association, $r < 0$ indicates negative linear association and $r = 0$ indicates no linear association
- $r = 0$ doesn’t mean no relationship and it is entirely possible for two variables to have some relationship (such as quadratic relationship) while having $r = 0$
- Sample correlation is unit free

## Correlation in SAS

Let us load data from the website directly this time. We will feed the url of the data from our professor's data set site as follows;

```sas
filename oec url "http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~kcowles/Datasets/OECD.dat";
data OECD;
infile oec;
input country $ 13. pcgdp pch beds los docs infmort ;
run ;
```

- Note that the `13.` in the `input` statement tells SAS the number of characters in the longest country name. Without this information **SAS would truncate the country names to 8 letters each**.

- We tell to SAS that there are 8 variables in the dataset; `country pcgdp pch beds los docs infmort` and `country` is not a numerical variable (`$` sign).

### Scatter plots

Let us draw the scatter plot in SAS. Here is the syntax of drawing scatter plot:

```sas
PROC sgscatter  DATA=DATASET;
   PLOT VARIABLE_1 * VARIABLE_2
RUN;
```

We have many variables in our data set. Let us pick `pch` and `pcgdp`.

```sas
proc sgscatter data = OECD ;
title "Scatter plot of pch and pcgdp";
  plot pch * pcgdp;
run ;
```

### Correlation in SAS

We can calculate the sample correlation in SAS by using `corr`.

```sas
proc corr data = OECD ;
var pcgdp pch ;
run ;
```

The output is as follows:

```sas
                                      The CORR Procedure

                               2  Variables:    pcgdp    pch

                               pcgdp       1.00000       0.87420
                                                          <.0001

                               pch         0.87420       1.00000
                                            <.0001
                                                29            29
```

The sample correlation between `pch` and `pcgdp` is 0.87420, which indicates that the two variables are positively correlated each other.

## Regression in SAS

Regression can be done by `reg` key word.

```sas
proc reg data = OECD ;
model pch = pcgdp ;           * model <resp vbl> = <explanatory vbl> ;
run ;
```

The `model` code indicates that we want to use the following form of regression line;

$$
\hat{pch} = intercept + slope \times pcgdp
$$

The following is the output:

```

Based on the result we have, we know that the estimation formula looks like this:

$$
\hat{pch} = -465.66368 + 0.09682 \times pcgdp
$$

### Prediction using the formula

How can we predict `pch` of a country whose `pcdgp` is $2000$ using the above formula? We can simply plug in the $2000$ to the above formula;

$$
\hat{pch} = -465.66368 + 0.09682 \times 2000 = -272.0237
$$

SAS provides the command for obtaining the prediction values of `pch` which corresponding to the each data point.

```sas
proc reg data = OECD ;
model pch = pcgdp / p ;
id country ;
run ;
```

Output:
